# cyclist-case-study
## Introduction
The Google Data Analytics Certification course on coursera includes capstone projects to complete.This is my first case study and I have chosen the Cyclist Dataset for this project. In order to answer the key business questions, I have followed these steps:
* Ask
* Prepare
* Process
* Analyze
* Share
* Act
## Project Description
## Scenerio
You are a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director
of marketing believes the companyâ€™s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore,
your team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights,
your team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives
must approve your recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data
visualizations.
## Ask phase
What is the problem you are trying to solve?
The main objective is to analyse how casual riders and annual members use Cyclist bikes differently.

How can your insights drive business decions?
The insights gotten would be used to create strategies on how casual riders can be annual members.
 
In order to answer these questions and for my analysis, I have chosen a twelve month period from April 2020 to March 2021.
This is the original [dataset](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html) and [Licence](https://ride.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement)

## Prepare phase
Tools I selected for this project are;
* PowerBI
* Excel
###### Initial assessment on the dataset in microsoft excel
* Inspected all 12 datasets to check if they were accurate and reliable and then noticed columns start_station_name, start_station_id, end_station_name, end_station_id had too many null values.

## Process phase
#### Data Cleaning and Manipulation
After the assessment, the data was imported into Power BI and merged.

By using power query all these were performed to get the data ready for analysis;
* Checked for duplicates and deleted all rows with the same ride_id
* Checked and removed all null values
* Trimmed all the columns to make sure there won't be issues with whitespaces.
* Adding a column ride_length, start_day_of_week, start_month, ride_length, and start_month_number which would be needed in the analysis.
* The average ride_length, maximum ride_length and mode of start_day_of_week are also found and are used in the analysis.

The data is now cleaned and ready for analysis.

## Analysing the dataset
###### Number of rides versus Analysis of weekday

![Count of ride ID](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68378328/213943922-dbb16444-e4f5-4073-bb44-12e550b25649.jpg)

It is shown that annual members account for 59.02% and 40.98% for casual riders of the rides taken.

###### Analysis of Number of rides and Weekday

![day of the week](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68378328/214164915-3cc639cf-818d-4f2d-af7a-4266f3885604.jpg)

This shows the rides taken in a week, 0 being Monday and 6 being Sunday. For both casual riders and members, the number of rides taken fluctuates as the week goes by from Monday and is at it's highest on Saturday.However, the number of rides taken by Casual riders are more on Saturday than that of Members and for the rest of the week, the number of rides taken by Casual riders are lower than that of Members.

###### Queried to check if Casual riders and Members prefer to ride in any specific month as compared to others


![Monthly analysis](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68378328/214172301-8e77c2c8-ed41-4af3-81ea-6ccfbf43f8d5.jpg)

Throughout the year, the number of rides taken by Casual riders is lower than that of Members. We can also see that for both Members and Casual riders, the number of rides taken fluctuates in the first four month, then in May it increases and reaches it's highest point in August and then declines for the rest of the year.

###### Queried to see the what time the volume of ride is at it's highest between annual members and casual riders

![start time](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68378328/216705561-0a591fd8-c36c-4537-aa74-b49256c93a21.jpg)

The volume of ride is low in the mornings but then steadily increases till about 5pm before dropping again. Also, the number of casual riders is more in the morning from late night till early morning but annual members represent a bigger volume throughout the rest of the day.
###### Checked to see if Casual riders or Members preferred any type of bike

![Rideable type#](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68378328/214173874-eb1a6914-7d01-4828-aaea-afa81888a215.jpg)

Both Casual riders and Members preferred the docked_bike and the least favourite was the electric_bike

###### The mean ride length


![Mean](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68378328/216705317-3bb12146-d1e8-4a9e-b0c0-2b899c853435.jpg)

The mean ride length for Casual riders is greater than that of Members throughout the week.

## Share Phase
###### Trends to note
* The usage pattern between annual members differ from casual riders
* Docked bikes are the most preferrable type of bike
* The average riding time for members is lower than that of casual riders

## Act phase
The analysis done on this dataset showed that the usage pattern between annual members and casual riders differ as regards to weekday, weekend trends and also during a particular time. Annual members are shown to use the services more during the weekday and also durng peak hours compared to casual riders who use the services more during weekends and off peak hours.

This analysis can be used by the marketing team to create strategies that would convince casual riders to become annual members as they significantly constitute a larger percentage of the customer base.
