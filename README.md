## Project Description
## Scenerio
You are a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director
of marketing believes the companyâ€™s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore,
your team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights,
your team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives
must approve your recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data
visualizations.
## Question
 How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclist bikes differently?
 
In order to answer this question and for my analysis, I have chosen a twelve month period from September 2021 to August 2022.
